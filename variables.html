<h3>JavaScript Variables</h3>
    <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing values.Var is the keyword for variables</p>

    <p><code>var x=  5;<br  />
        var y = 6; var z = x + y;
    </code></p>

    <p>All JavaScript variables must be given unique names, which are known as <b>identifiers</b> Identifiers can be short names like x or y,
    or longer more descriptive names like CreditCardNumber. The general rules for contructing variables names (identifiers) is listed below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs ($).</li>
        <li>Names must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($) or underscore (_)</li>
        <li>Names are case sensitive (x and X are different variables</li>
        <li>Reserved words (JavaScript keywords) cannot be used</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is important to note the in JavaScript = is an assignment operator, not an equal to operator. For example,
        the following does not make sense in algebra, but makes sense in JavaScript.</p>

    <p><code>x = x + 5</code></p>

<h5>Digits and Strings</h5>    

        <p>There are many value types in JavaScript. For now we will focus on strings (text) and digits(numbers).
            Numbers don't need to be sourrounded with quotation marks ("") but strings do. If you put some digits in quotes, the rest 
            will be treated as strings. For example, the following will return 234.
        </p>

        <p><code>var x = "2" + 3 + 4;</code></p>

<h5>One Statement Many Variables</h5>

        <p>Multiple variables can be included in one statement.</p>
    
    <p><code> var person = "Johnny", carName = "Hyundai", price = 300;</code></p>
