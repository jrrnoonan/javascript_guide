<h3>Comments</h3>

    <p>There are two types of comments in JavaScript. <b>Single line</b> and <b>multi-line comments</b>. Comments can be useful for explaining code 
        to make changes easier in the future. They can also be used to comment out bad code until it can be fixed later.</p> 
        
    <p><b>Single-line comments</b> begin with two forward slashes // and end when the line ends.  </p>

    <p><b>Multi-line comments</b> begin with /* and end with */. JavaScript will ignore all text between those symbols.</p>
