<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

    <p>You can create a variable that stores more then one value. This is called an object. Here is an example below</p>

    <p><code>var car= {type:"Chevrolet", model:"Chevelle", color:"blue" year:"1970" engine:"ls6"};</code></p>

    <p>The name value pairs created above are called properties. You access properties in one of 2 ways</p>

    <p><code>object.Name.propertyName (car.type)</code></p>

    <p><code>objectName["propertyName"] (car["type"];)</code></p>

<h2>Object Methods</h2>

    <p>An Object method is a function stored as a property.</p>

    <p><code><pre>
        var person = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            id : 5566,
            fullName : function() {
                return this.firstName + "" + this.lastName;
            }
        }
    </pre></code></p>
<h3>Then this Keyword</h3>
    <p>In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function. In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" 
       the fullName function. In other words. this.firstName means the firstName property of <b>this object.</b></p>

<h2>Accessing Object Methods</h2>       

    <p>You can access an object method with the following syntax:
    </p>

    <p><code>objectName.methodName()</code></p>

    <p><code>name = person.fullName;</code></p>

<h2>Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!</h2>

    <p>When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object. Avoid string, 
        number, and Boolean objects. They complicate yout code and slow down execution speed.</p>

    <p><code>var x = new String();</code></p>
