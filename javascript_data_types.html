<h3>JavaScript Data Types</h3>    

    <p>In order to operate on variables, JavsScript neesds to know the type of data its working with. JavaScript variables 
        hold many types of data, including numbers, strings, and objects. These different variables are known as data types (many programming
        languages use data types). Without data types, a computer can't accurately solve this:
    </p>

    <p><code>var x = 16 + "Tuesday";</code></p>

    <p>Usually, we don't add numbers to text(strings), so how does JavaScript handle this? Push the buton below to find out.</p>

    <button onclick= "window.alert(16 +'Tuesday')">Click me</button>

    <p id="demo">As displayed in the alert box, JavaScript treats numbers as strings when they are added to strings</p>

    <p>JavaScript evaluates expressions from right to left. Different sequences can produce different results: For example: <br  />
        <code>var x = 16 + 4 + "Chicken";</code> will compute <code>20Chicken</code>. <br  />
        <code>var x = "Lettuce" + 16 + 4</code> will compute <code>Lettuce164</code>
    </p>

    <p>These above statements are treated differently because of the order of strings and numbers. JavaScript treats all numbers as numbers
        until it reaches a string. At that point, the sum of all previous numbers is treated as a string, and all proceeding numbers are 
        treated as strings.
    </p>
